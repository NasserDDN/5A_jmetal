# 5A Jmetal optimizations

jMetal is a Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics.

This repository contains some example of optimization (1 mono-objective with GA algorithm and 2 multi-objectives with NSGA algorithm).

Problem classes are located in **src/classes** folder. Algorithms files that are useful to change are X_main.java files (X : algorithm name).

Pareto fronts can be displayed with the python script.
